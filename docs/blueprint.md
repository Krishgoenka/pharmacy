## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Light, calming blue (#ADD8E6), evoking a sense of trust and health.
- Background color: Off-white (#F8F8FF), to ensure readability.
- Accent color: A gentle green (#90EE90), inspired by plants and health, to highlight key CTAs and sections.
- Body font: 'PT Sans' (sans-serif), for clear and readable text. Headline font: 'Playfair' (serif) for headlines to give a slightly elegant feel to the pharmacy services.
- Use simple, clear icons to represent each service category (e.g., a mortar and pestle for 'Chemists,' a truck for 'Home Delivery,' a test tube for 'Medical Tests,' and a doctor's coat for 'Doctors').
- Maintain a clean and organized layout with clear sections, ample spacing, and a consistent visual hierarchy to ensure ease of navigation.
- Subtle transitions and animations to create a smooth and engaging user experience (e.g., a fade-in effect when loading new content, or a gentle slide-in for the 'Best Deals' section).
